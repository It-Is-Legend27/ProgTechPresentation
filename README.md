### Problem summary:
##### [[Full problem statement here](https://onlinejudge.org/external/101/10135.pdf)]
You are given a set of Cartesian points that each represent the location of a "Frosh" (a college freshman) relative to the telephone post in meters. The telephone has the coordinate point of the origin (0,0). The goal is for all the "Frosh" to be round up with "the minimum amount of silk necessary to encircle all the Frosh". <sup>1</sup> The restriction is that there will be no more than 1000 Frosh.

### The Goal:
Essentially, the goal is to find the minimum length of silk need to surround all the "Frosh". The silk will be tied to a telephone pole, will enclose all the "Frosh" in a manner that the minimum length of silk will be used, and will finally return back to the telephone to be tied.

### Explanation
Given the information in the problem statement, it is clear that the goal of the problem is to construct some sort of polygon, given the coordinates of the Frosh, where the polygon has the smallest perimeter possible. It can be ruled out that a non-convex polygon, or concave polygon would not be of good use in this situation, as it would not provide that shortest possible perimeter. Furthermore, even the smallest possible circle that will encompass all the freshman would be of no use, as it would still require constructing a polygon, a cylic polgyon to be exact, and such a polygon would still have a perimeter smaller than the circle.<sup>5</sup>

### Non-convex Polygon Example

> <br> In the image above, the combination of the blue and yellow portions represent the convex hull, and the blue portion alone represents a simple polygon.<sup>6</sup> From mere observation, it can be concluded that the simple polygon would have a much greater perimeter than the convex hull, thus finding the perimeter of a non-convex polygon is not of use for solving the "Herding the Frosh" problem.

### Circle Example

>![InscribedTriangle](https://useruploads.socratic.org/wwCKF99KTWGvJwQllTV9_equilateralTriangle.gif) <br>
> <br> In the figure above, the inscribed equilateral has a side length of 
approximately 58.25, thus the perimeter of the triangle is 174.75.<sup>4</sup> The circumference of the circle is 2Ï€r, where the radius r is 36. The circumference of the circle above is approximately 226.19, therefore my previously stated conjectured regarding the circumscribing circle not having the smallest length of silk holds true. For other polygons, it holds, since every polgyon inscribed in a circle is convex, but I shall spare the proof as it is a bit tedious to prove such a statement.

### How To Solve:
The solution here is to take the set of points in the test case to come up with a convex hull. Then, from there we will find the shortest length from the origin to a vertex of the convex hull. Once that is done, we will compute the length of silk,  _`l`_, using the perimeter of the polygon create by the convex hull, _`P`_, and the shortest length from the origin to a vertex, _`s`_. The formula for the shortest length of silk used will be:
```
l = P + 2s
```

### Simple Psuedocode for the Solution
```python
# Coordinates of telephone pole, O
origin = (0,0)

# no. of test cases
T = input()

# Find the shortest length of silk for each case
for c = 0 : 1 : T-1
    
    # get no. of Frosh
    N = input()
    
    # Create viable data structure, array, to hold N no. frosh coords
    F[N]
    
    # Read in all frosh coords
    for i = 0 : 1 : N-1
        F[i] = input()
    end-for
    
    # Find the set of points that form the convex hull, C, for given set of coords, F
    # Refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convex-hull-set-2-graham-scan/ for more info
    C[] = GrahamScan(F)
    
    # Compute the perimeter, P of convex hull
    P = 0
    
    # Save set of shortest distances to O, D for later use
    D[C.size]

    # Calculate each distance from each vertex to O, then put into D.
    # Then, calculate each edge length of the convex hull and add to P.
    # NOTE: It is assumed that the points are ordered in such a manner that
    # you would be looping over them in a clock-wise / counterclock-wise manner,
    # so each edge would be computed correctly.
    for i = 0:1:C.size-1
        D[i] = distance(C[i], origin)
        P += distance(C[i+1 % C.size], C[i])
    end-for
    
    # Set first side length as shortest length to begin
    S = D[0]
    
    # Iterate through all side lengths, set S to D[i] if shorter side found
    for i = 1:1:D.size-1
        if D[i] < S
            S = D[i]
        end-if
    end-for
    
    # Calculate total length
    l = P + 2*s
    
    # Display the perimeter
    print(l)
end-for
```
